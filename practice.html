Distance may keep us apart, but the bond we share remains unwavering. I find solace in our memories, and the hope of reuniting keeps me going. I miss the camaraderie, the inside jokes, and the comfort of your presence. Here's to the times we've had and to the moments we'll create again when we meet."
